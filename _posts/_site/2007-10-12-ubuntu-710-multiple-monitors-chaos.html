I have already started early testing of Ubuntu 7.10 (<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/gutsybeta">Gutsy Gibbon</a>). I am very impressed so far with the stability, performance and features. Today, I tried to configure multiple monitors for presentation. After lots of efforts I couldn't configure them in proper way. Whenever projector screen was being used, laptop screen resolution will get messed up.

After lots of efforts I couldn't get it working and finally I gave up. I think, Gutsy is just not ready yet. So far, I couldn't get the multiple monitors working. Somebody has already started a thread <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=570231">here.</a> (Sorry... no replies yet :( )

I just hope that this feature will be better supported in main release or at least in a patch, as early as possible.

For now, I guess at least with beta this kind of humour still stands true. :)
