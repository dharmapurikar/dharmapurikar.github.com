I always read the "Not so stupid questions" series on <a href="http://today.java.net/">Java Today</a>. It was becoming difficult for me to keep the questions list. Sometime, you need the questions list and you don't find it; don't you hate that? First thing came to mind was my blog! After all we are supposed to use these tools to organize our personal information; isn't it? Blogs were invented for that,so I thought to make a list as a post and let others find the entire list in one place.

I googled for stupid questions list but I couldn't find a single page enlisting all of them. :( But this problem is not there anymore. You would like to bookmark this page for your reference ;)
