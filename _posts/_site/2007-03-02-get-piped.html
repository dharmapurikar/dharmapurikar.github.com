Have you checked <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Pipes</a>? I am really bad at predictions but I think this is going to be a great tool for bloggers, personal websites and even for commercials! The simple concept involved in pipes is really so powerful! When I first used Google Reader the way Google creates a stream of RSS feeds appealed me a lot.

Pipes is sequence of different modules which can do variety of things for you. You can ask for user input, sort the output, filter posts and lots of other things. This gives you complete liberty to process the RSS feed!

In two minutes I created a pipe. To demonstrate its power, wanna read my blog in French? Here comes the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/8F_MQZvI2xGIumsKZoQMOQ/run?_render=rss">feed</a>!
