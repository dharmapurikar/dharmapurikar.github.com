As I announced <a href="http://thoughtworker.in/2006/12/19/new-look-for-the-blog/">earlier</a>, I am going to join <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.co.in">ThoughtWorks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune">Pune</a> development center. For past 18 months, I lived in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad,_India">Hyderabad</a>. This was a wonderful experience. People of different language, culture and attire! One of the best times of my life!

For all the good time I had, I owe thank to following list of people. Shriram (raamya) for his coffee breaks and wonderful thought experiments. You're the man! Akshay and group for helping me in first days @ Hyderabad. Madan and Surabh for providing occasional company! :)

At last my crew from <a href="http://www.akanksha.com">Akanksha</a>; Rambabu for wonderful political, regional and personal views, movies and entertainment. I had lots of good discussion with you. Kameshwar for his humor and enjoyable discussions. Sridevi, Padmavati for their co-operation and fun. Sneha for her brain biting discussions! ;) Manoj for wonderful times having technical discussion and countless fun parties!

Radio City 106.4 / 91.1 FM for their wonderful music! Aparna (RJ for 'Chalo Chalte Raho' show) for her wonderful talks and entertainment. Thank you for giving me opportunity to speak me on Radio for 90 seconds on 6th December, 2006. I specially enjoyed your show everyday on the way to office. You are my favorite RJ for the year 2006! Gautami (RJ for 'Nato Vastara' show) for her sweet talks and cute behavior. You are a wonderful person with a great smile. I don't know Telugu but just your show taught me to understand some of words! Being a Marathi person, I enjoyed your show everyday on way back to home!

Thanks to Sify for providing me internet services for whole year. Not the best, but you are good provider. Without you, this was impossible to have wonderful discussion with my loving friend Neelesh in USA.

Thanks to Neelesh for talking me almost everyday and talking on lots of topics. Great company dude! Hope to continue same discussions from Pune.

Final thanks go to my movie library person (Anna) who provided me hundreds of movies throughout the year! You made my holidays enjoyable! Thanks to <a href="http://www.prasadz.com">Prasads IMAX</a>, <a href="http://www.pvrcinemas.com">PVR Cinemas</a>, Sangeet, and Raja for showing me great movies for the weekends and holidays.

Altogether, the stay at Hyderabad was wonderful and definitely added lots of memories to my personal life. I learned lots of things which will help me through the rest of time. Tonight I start my final journey towards Pune. Given a chance, will love to be a Hyderabadi! Again!

Thank you for the all persons who became part of life in Hyderabad. I always owe a big Thank to you.

Good bye Hyderabad!
