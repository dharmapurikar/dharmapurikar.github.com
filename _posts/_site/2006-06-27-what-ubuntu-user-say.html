I was on vacation for last few days. :) I got chance to talk to once of my friend who is using <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu </a>on his laptop. He was using Breezy Badger distribution and the laptop was little old and upgraded one. I was curious to have a talk with him regarding his suggestion / feedback.

He was also going through same cycle of happiness which I experienced <a href="http://dharmapurikar.wordpress.com/2006/06/09/ubuntu-painful-re-install/">before</a>! What made me more curious was, he was using a 3-4 years old laptop which was upgraded in terms of RAM and other hardware. That was IBM Thinkpad with earlier Pentium 4 processors. He said, he could run it smoothly and there were no hardware issues at all! He could install everything very easily and comfortably. That is a reason for toast!

He was happy with performance and also features. I would like to mention his one quote, which everybody will agree... "It is better than Windows XP!"
