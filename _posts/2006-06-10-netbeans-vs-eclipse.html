Let me clear in beginning, I am strong fan of <a href="www.eclipse.org" target="_blank" title="Eclipse website">Eclipse</a>. I have been using Eclipse for past 3 years and its very powerful. I love it for whole lot of reasons which I can't mention here. In Javaone conference I heard a lot about cool <a href="www.netbeans.org" target="_blank" title="NetBeans home">NetBeans </a>demos and features. I just thought to give a try to that. I was not hoping much from NetBeans. I installed IDE, enterprise pack &amp; profiler.  I created a simple web-application project. The integrated Glassfish / Sun App server really makes testing very easy. Just out-of-curiosity I clicked on debug button after placing a breakpoint in bean and surprisingly it allowed me to debug my web-application. Previously I remember, I used to spend lots of hours by writing log traces and analyzing them to debug application. Man, thatâ€™s really handy!Beyond that, UML modeling (both way), testing, Web-services &amp; BPEL integration makes NetBeans a real powerful JavaEE IDE. Tons of wizards are available to perform typical coding / modification tasks. Its aware of Java 2, 5 &amp; 6 syntax aware so it makes development easier for any version of Java. JSF &amp; Struts are integrated so no worry for web developers.But I need to admit the editor of Eclipse is far rich than NetBeans. For everything else the NetBeans is just superb! Waiting for more in coming days. :)<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font>
