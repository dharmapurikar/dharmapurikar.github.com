I just had a look at OpenOffice.org 2.0 and it rocks! You just see how many features are loaded there. Moreover, its free. I have decided that from now on I will install only viewers for Microsoft Office and for my day to day office purpose I will use OpenOffice. There are few differences in them like the macro definition language. But almost any office document can be opened into OpenOffice. Good work OpenOffice team. Just have a look at <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">here</a>.
