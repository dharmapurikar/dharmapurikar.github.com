I am a Linux user by large. Lately I migrated to Mac as it worked better for me. (...and they look beautiful!) Although, I found from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/hyfather">@hyfather</a>Â that there is significant difference between Mac based utilities vs Linux-based. This difference exists as Linux has GNU coreutils and Mac has BSD based.

Many switches are different, output is different and it is very frustrating to experienced users.

I ran into <code>netstat</code> command recently. I needed to find out pid of <code>memcached</code> server on my mac. Spend few mins but no luck. Mac based <code>netstat</code> command won't understand <code>-p</code> switch. Aaargh! I had to use <code>lsof</code> to get my job done.

Here is how I did it -

<pre>sudo lsof -i -P|grep memcache</pre>

Worked great!
