I keep getting following warning lately on my mac.
<pre>ruby warning: Insecure world writable dir /usr/local/bin, mode 040777</pre>
Little research and I found, Ruby warns you about any world writeable directory in your PATH. Not only writeable directories but parents as well.

Fix is super quick.
<pre>chmod o-w /usr/local/bin</pre>
You can replace /usr/local/bin with any directory which ruby complains about. This fixes the issue.
