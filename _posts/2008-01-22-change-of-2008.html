If you are reading this post in RSS feed reader, then I think you should visit this post on the blog. I have now hosted blog at new <a href="http://railsplayground.com/" title="Rails Playground" target="_blank">place</a>. I owe a big Thank to <a href="http://wordpress.com" title="Wordpress">Wordpress</a>  for providing me great services for over two years. I believe that wordpress is the most powerful yet simple blogging service of all. I wanted to move to new hosting provider on the first day of 2008 but somehow couldn't make it.  I have now migrated all the blog with posts and comments.

I have more things to add to this place now. I will keep you posted about that in coming days. I am even going to put another blog (personal) for my personal, friends and family updates. You can find that <a href="http://www.dharmapurikar.in">here</a>.

More is coming on the way.
