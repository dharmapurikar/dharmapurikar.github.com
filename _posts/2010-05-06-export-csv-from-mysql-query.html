As you might be aware that I started a "<a title="Murmurs category on ThoughtBlog" href="http://thoughtworker.in/category/murmur/" target="_self">Murmur</a>" category on my blog. I discover or learn these tips on day-to-day basis and just forget them. Sometimes those takes hours to come with one or often it boils down to just a google search. In any case, you might want to refer to these tips in future as well. So I decided to keep a log of them publicly so that it can help others too.

Many times I need to get dump of data which is output of a sql query. MySQL makes it very easy to output the query result as csv file from command line. Following command should create a names.csv file in $MYSQL_INSTALLATION/data/$DB_NAME/ directory. This command comes very handy when you're working on remote shell where you don't have any GUI tools.
<pre lang="sql">SELECT first_name, last_name INTO OUTFILE 'names.csv'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
ESCAPED BY '\\'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
from employee;</pre>
Very useful.
