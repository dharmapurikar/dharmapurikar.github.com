The second huddle in the way to enjoy Kubuntu and my Laptop, WPA support for my home wireless LAN. Finally, I could get a workaround with it by installing the proper driver. You can find the drivers <a href="http://ipw3945.sourceforge.net/">here</a>. There is a great Install guide which helps to get most out of it.

Enjoy Wi-Fi on Kubuntu. :)
