When you're working on large java code-base, its not very difficult to run in situation where you get a ClassNotFoundException. Many times we have a daunting task to find where the class is located and it is not very easy task. I found this nice utility called "<a title="Jarscan" href="http://www.inetfeedback.com/jarscan/" target="_blank">jarscan</a>" which makes life much easier.

Worked great for me today!
