Have you opened a read-only file and modified it but couldn't save? Not anymore, I found a quick tip which allows VIM users to save the file as 'sudo' even if you didn't use 'sudo' at the time of opening.
</p>
<p>
  Create a shorthand mapping in VIM as follows:
</p>

<pre>cmap w!! %!sudo tee &gt; /dev/null %</pre>

<p>
You can save this to your ~/.vimrc file to persist it.
</p>
<p>
Now every time you want to override the read-only status and save changes as sudo, just hit 'w!!' and you'll be good.
</p>

Love the power of VIM!
